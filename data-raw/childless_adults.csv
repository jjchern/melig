"Notes"
"All eligibility limits calculated as a percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)."
""
"Reflects income eligibility limits for coverage that provides full Medicaid benefits. Eligibility limits for waiver programs that provide more limited benefits or for fully state-funded programs are not included."
""
"Changes over time reflect policy changes and, in some cases, changes in state reporting. Changes between January 2013 and 2014 reflect the ACA Medicaid expansion in some states and the conversion to MAGI-based income eligibility standards. Some changes between January 2014 and January 2015 reflect continued adjustments to these MAGI conversions."
""
"Beginning in 2014, income limits include a disregard equal to five percentage points of the FPL."
""
"Does not include information regarding periods of time new enrollment may have been closed under a waiver program."
