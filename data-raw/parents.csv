"Sources"
"Based on a national survey conducted by KFF with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2003-2009; and with the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families, 2011-2023. See [Annual Updates on Eligibility Rules, Enrollment and Renewal Procedures, and Cost-Sharing Practices in Medicaid and CHIP](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/report/annual-updates-on-eligibility-rules-enrollment-and-renewal-procedures-and-cost-sharing-practices-in-medicaid-and-chip/) for all survey reports."

"Definitions"
"All eligibility limits calculated as a percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)."
""
"*NR*: Data not reported."

"Notes"
"Reflects income eligibility limits for coverage that provides full Medicaid benefits. Eligibility limits for waiver programs that provide more limited benefits or for fully state-funded programs are not included."
""
"Income eligibility limits for parents are calculated based on a family of three. In some states, eligibility limits for Section 1931 parents are based on a dollar threshold, and the values listed represent the FPL equivalents calculated from these dollar limits using the applicable FPL for that year."
""
"Changes over time reflect policy changes as well as routine annual adjustments in some states. In some cases, changes may reflect changes in state reporting. Changes between January 2013 and 2014 reflect the ACA Medicaid expansion in some states and the conversion to MAGI-based income eligibility standards. Some changes between January 2014 and January 2015 reflect continued adjustments to these MAGI conversions."
""
"Data prior to 2014 take states’ earnings disregards, when applicable, into account when determining eligibility limits. Beginning in 2014, income limits include a disregard equal to five percentage points of the FPL."
""
"Does not include information regarding periods of time new enrollment may have been closed under a waiver program."
