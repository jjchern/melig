"Notes"
"Reflects the highest income eligibility limit for children under Medicaid or CHIP."
""
"Changes over time reflect policy changes and, in some cases, changes in state reporting. Changes between January 2013 and 2014 reflect conversion to MAGI-based income eligibility standards. Some changes between January 2014 and January 2015 reflect continued adjustments to these MAGI conversions."
""
"Beginning in 2014, income limits include a disregard equal to five percentage points of the FPL."
""
"Does not include information regarding periods of time new enrollment may have been closed to children in separate CHIP programs."
