"Notes"
"All eligibility limits calculated as a percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)."
""
"Reflects the highest income eligibility limit for children starting at age six up until their 19th birthday under ""regular"" Medicaid (Title XIX), for whom the state receives Medicaid matching payments, or under a CHIP-funded (Title XXI) Medicaid expansion program."
""
"Income eligibility limits for October 2000 and June 2002 are for children ages 6-17."
""
"Changes over time reflect policy changes and, in some cases, changes in state reporting. Changes between January 2013 and 2014 reflect conversion to MAGI-based income eligibility standards. Some changes between January 2014 and January 2015 reflect continued adjustments to these MAGI conversions."
""
"Beginning in 2014, income limits include a disregard equal to five percentage points of the FPL."
